Cloud Pictures - Free for public use

Thanks for your interest in these cloud pictures. They are available for your use for free. 
I do ask for attribution. You can use the following format:

I am interested in knowing what people use the cloud pictures for. To use the photos, I request that you fork the repository, and put in a comment when you fork letting me know your intended use. 

I will be adding more cloud photos in the future, so if you want to know when they are added, be sure to click "watch" option for this repository.
